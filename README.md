# Project-LabEmbeddedDesign1

All the designed code and written reports created for **Lab Embedded Design 1** at **KULeuven Technologiecampus Gent - Master's Electronics Engineering** are gathered here. **Chris Thoen** helped with the research and reports but I mostly focussed on developing the code.

The main project also uses code from **dbprint**, this needs to be added alongside the code on this repository to get the code working. See [dbprint GIT repo](https://github.com/Fescron/dbprint) for more info regarding this.
